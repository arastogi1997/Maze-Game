# Maze-Game
Visual animation of generation of a 2D-maze [a minimum spanning tree] by eager Prim's algorithm imlemented in Java.

Game commences once the maze completes. Controls : Arrow keys, reach goal before time finishes. Time and points to be gained are allotted in accordance with length of shortest path. Click to reset target.

'S' presents the solution [Dijkstra's algorithm] but causes time to pass very fast and results in penalty. Pressing S again sets the time-speed to normal.
